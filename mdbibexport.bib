  abstract	= {"Computational modeling can provide a wealth of insight
		  into how energy flow in proteins mediates protein function.
		  Computational methods can also address fundamental
		  questions related to molecular signaling and energy flow in
		  proteins. Proteins: Energy, Heat and Signal Flow presents
		  state-of-the-art computational strategies for studying
		  energy redistribution, signaling, and heat transport in
		  proteins and other molecular machines. The first of four
		  sections of the book address the transport of energy in
		  molecular motors, which function through a combination of
		  chemically driven large-scale conformational changes and
		  charge transport. Focusing on vibrational energy flow in
		  proteins and nanostructures, the next two sections discuss
		  approaches based on molecular dynamics simulations and
		  harmonic analysis. By exploring the flow of free energy in
		  proteins, the last section examines the conformational
		  changes involved in allosteric transitions and the role of
		  coupled protein-solvent dynamics in conformational changes.
		  It also presents computational approaches developed to
		  locate pathways between protein structures. The integrated
		  presentation of this comprehensive, up-to-date volume
		  emphasizes the interrelations between disparate
		  computational approaches that have contributed to our
		  understanding of energy flow in proteins and its role in
		  protein function. By defining the forefront of research in
		  this area, the book delineates the current challenges and
		  opportunities in developing novel methods and applications
		  for the evolving study of energy flow in molecular machines
		  and nanomaterials."--Publisher's description.},
